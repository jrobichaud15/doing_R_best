## Study Objectives

# Questions
- How does abundance change as elevation changes between orders?
- How does abundance change as elevation changes within orders?
- How does abundance change as latitude changes between orders?
- How does abundance change as latitude changes within orders?

# Possible Outcomes
- Abundance increases/decreases with elevation and orders show similar trends
- Abundance increases/decreases with elevation and orders show opposing trends
- Abundance increases/decreases with latitude and orders show similar trends
- Abundance increases/decreases with latitude and orders show opposing trends

- Family/genus/species (TBD) within an order show the same trends in abundance as ele/lat increases/decreases
- Family/genus/species (TBD) within an order show differnettrends in abundance as ele/lat increases/decreases
